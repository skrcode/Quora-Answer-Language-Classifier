      "Forget about date, your amazing marks can't even set a job for you.\n",
      "So, when college is over, the race to set your career starts. And you get more inclined in setting your job. The job takes up majority of your time leaving you only worthy of snoozing comfortably on weekends.\n",
      "Unless you find someone in college, it gets more and more difficult to find someone interesting in job.\n",
      "Half of the office is either married or already committed.\n",
      "Panic starts to set in. You want to feel the romance in your life. So you turn to dating sites.\n",
      "You go to tinder. And you are bombarded with ready to hook up people. The overwhelming freaking texts makes you ultimately uninstall it.\n",
      "Your friends are married. The few guys in your friend circle are committed. Even their other friend circle is full of married and committed people.\n",
      "You start mentally dating some celebs, fictional characters, TV characters. And the actors who play this.. Ironically, even those actors are either married or committed.\n",
      "Basically everyone around you is with someone, except you.\n",
      "Congratulations, Now you are 29 years old. You are the only single person in every job you switch. You have started loving this single-hood, as your friends start whining about relationships. So you decide to remain single. You have achieved your happily ever after in sleeping, eating and watching awesome series. (God, please bring GOT back soon.. :’( .. )\n",
      "Meanwhile, your parents are going crazy over matrimony sites. But you couldn’t care less, because you have learnt to live a single life, enjoying movies alone, not talking late nights and sleeping like a log. :P\n",

      "Your parents are tired of this cycle. They get paranoid the moment you say “Not interested” to any profile. They ask you if you like someone. They even comment that you should have found someone in college for yourself. Ultimately it’s all our fault. *Much wow*\n",

      " The unit of any society is a home in the very basic perspective. When the basics would not be strong how can the building be strong which is developed on those basics. This is the very same situation in modern societies, the family bonds are not that strong as they used to be resulting in the weakness in the society as a whole and a frustrated youth which can not play its part productively towards national growth. Topic 46 Qualities of a good son or daughter It is commonly known that parents expect to see their children behaving decently and respectfully. It is extremely important for parents to provide to their kids a clear explanation of what is bad and what is good. Hence, by having parents' support and advices, children could achieve the important qualities that later their parents could be proud of. In my opinion, the basic qualities of a being a good son or daughter have been remaining the same over years. The most important quality, I think, is that we should respect our parents. It was our parents who brought us into the world and brought us up. They provided us food and clothes, and send us to schools to be educated.\n"

You guys are getting better,” Ryan said. Yeah right, maybe in thirty years, I thought grimly. “So you don’t enjoy this?” What was Ryan thinking? Enjoy? Enjoy? I was in danger of tearing that ball into roughly fifty pieces. “Not really,” I ventured mildly. “Fine then, we don’t have to do this.
