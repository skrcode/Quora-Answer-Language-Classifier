"What is one thing you caught your parents doing that you wish you had never seen?

Going anonymous as I don’t want my parents to know about how much impact this had on me.

I was about 16 years of age when this happened. It was the last week of the month and a few of our family friends visited us for chit chat after dinner. When they showed up and said, “hey guys, lets have ice cream together,” my parents said yes very reluctantly and they just went inside one of the bedrooms. I was not sure why they were not excited as I was sure as hell thrilled to eat ice cream. After some time, when they didn’t return from the room, I opened the door and walked in to see, that they had opened up my piggy bank and were counting money (pennies, coins, some notes). I was shocked that they had opened my piggy bank and when they saw me standing, they said “honey, sorry we have to use your money for ice cream now as papa is out of money for the month and will return it back on 1st of the next month when salary is received”. I just looked that their pale but hopeful faces staring at me. For some reason I understood the situation, and they gave me 180 rupees to run down to the store to buy some ice cream, which I did and we all had it with the visitors.

I really wish I had not seen this as it created a sub image of my parents (being helpless and short of money) in my mind which I can’t get rid of. It changed me in a way that I simply decided to earn money so desperately that my parents never are short of money by end of the month. In that process, I went away from them for years to stay abroad and earn, ran behind money and stability like crazy hell. Gave up on all entertainment and fun in youth to just focus on money and getting family out of financial troubles. Today we are not millionaires but have bunch of properties in US and India, earn very well, have good money to spend.

But I wished I never ever get to see that sorry state of financial affairs for my parents again. I saw it once and wish to never repeat it. Have spent my life sacrificing a lot to ensure it."
